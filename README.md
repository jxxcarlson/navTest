## Purpose

Simple demo of a `Browser.application` which renders
math text using custom elements.

## Setup

Set up `nginx` with  (`brew install nginx` on mac os).
Copy the supplied `nginx.conf` to `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

Use elm 0.19 for compilation.  Edit `make.sh` so 
that you are using the right compiler binary.  You 
will have to change `Users/carlson/Downloads/2/elm`
to be compatible with your local setup.

Use `sh make.sh -i` to compile to `Main.js` 
and use the supplied `index.html` file.
